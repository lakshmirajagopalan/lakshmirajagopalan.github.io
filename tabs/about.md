Hi, I'm Lakshmi — a Chennaiite with a long-standing love for computer science, data systems, and and the occasional gaming break.  
When I'm not deep into pipelines or architecture diagrams, I’m usually traveling with my husband or exploring new places to clear my head.

Professionally, I’m a senior data engineer and architect with over 12 years of experience across the data ecosystem.  
I work extensively with Databricks, Spark, Scala, distributed systems, and large-scale data pipelines.  
My interests span data architecture, system design, search systems, and the evolving intersection of AI and engineering.
